## Currently

I am currently working at [ESR](https://www.esr.cri.nz/) (Institute of Environmental Science and Research) as a Senior Scientist in Bioinformatics and Data Science. My work involves the creation of methods to deal with, and analyse, large genomic data sets. These methods include the incorporation of multiple layers of both phenotypic and genomic data. I work on a range of complex human disorders, including; obesity and type-2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, migraine, ovarian cancer and asthma. I am also leading the development of diagnostic and research pipelines for visualisation and translational interpretation of data from sequencing based approaches.
